This game takes in the letter the user types and lets compares it to a hidden letter the progam has chosen. If they match, user wins. if they don't match, the user loses. After 10 guesses, the game resets.

This was my first javascript project and I had to work through a lot of trial and error to get it to work. This challenge really helped me understand the syntax and formulaic design of javascript.
